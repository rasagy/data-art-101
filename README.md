# Generative Art 101
Collection of resources, exercises and activities for getting started with Generative Art. 
Compiled by @rasagy first for a Data Art workshop at [NID, Bangalore](http://www.nid.edu/institute/campuses/bengaluru.html) on 22nd Oct, 2016, that ended up becoming more generative art & P5 than just data art.

# Topics

- Introduction to the domain
- [Exploring computational design](https://github.com/rasagy/data-art-101/issues/1) through a hands-on activity (no code!)
- Introduction to creative coding (Weâ€™ll use P5.js, no prior coding knowledge needed)
- [Generative Art exercise I](https://github.com/rasagy/data-art-101/issues/2): Playing with Randomness
- Generative Art exercise II: Playing with data
- Discussion on how to implement ideas + collaborate further
